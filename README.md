# Iris-classification-using-ANN
A beginner-friendly deep learning project where I built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with TensorFlow/Keras to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their features. The project also includes an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions with a clean and attractive UI.
